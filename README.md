# rock-paper-scissors

##Rock, Paper and Scissors game project form The Odin Project Foundations##

I created the rock, paper, scissors game by dividing the problem into *four subproblems*, which are the four main functions that drive the game's logic.
I had a hard time getting the game to progress through five rounds while requiring user input each time.
The solution was simpler than expected. I had a lot of fun putting the project on paper with pseudocode and diagrams and then converting it all into code. It really does make everything easier... especially when you split the work across two different days.

# rock-paper-scissors

## Rock, Paper and Scissors game project form The Odin Project Foundations

I created the rock, paper, scissors game by dividing the problem into **four subproblems**, which are the four main functions that drive the game's logic.

I had a hard time getting the game to progress through five rounds while requiring user input each time.
The solution was simpler than expected. I had a lot of fun putting the project on paper with pseudocode and diagrams and then converting it all into code. It really does make everything easier... especially when you split the work across two different days.


**I reworked the project after learning DOM manipulation and managed to create a simple yet responsive and clean interface to make the game more interactive. I'm very happy with the result! I managed to incorporate some responsive design to make it work on mobile too. I did some research and learned a bit about the basics.**
